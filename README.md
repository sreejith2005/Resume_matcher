## üß† Scoring Logic

- **Skill Match:**  
  \[
  \text{Skill Score} = \frac{|\text{Resume Skills} \cap \text{JD Skills}|}{|\text{JD Skills}|} \times 100
  \]
- **Experience Bonus:**  
  If experience meets or exceeds JD, boosts match
- **Location Bonus:**  
  Exact match adds points  
- **Explainability:**  
  Missing and extra skills are clearly listed in results

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

- Place your domain skill list as `skill_list.csv` in the root
- For testing/demo, use files from the `dataset/` folder (resumes and JDs)
- You can expand the included skill/entity vocab for your own domain!

## üì¶ Deploy

- Run locally as above, or add a `Procfile` for Heroku:

    ```
